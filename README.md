# Hardware One

> Hardware One is an ESP32-based platform that turns a small microcontroller board into a capable, networked device. Attach sensors, a display, and input hardware, flash the firmware, and you have a standalone device with a web UI, an OLED interface, an ESP-NOW mesh network, and a full CLI — all configurable on the fly.

Built on **ESP-IDF** (not Arduino IDE). Runs on the **Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3**, **Adafruit QT PY ESP32**, and **Adafruit Feather ESP32** boards.

## Configurations

Hardware One can be used in several different ways depending on the hardware you attach and the role you want the device to play:

### 1) Barebones / Headless Node
- Just the microcontroller board — no display, no sensors, no gamepad.
- Full web UI, ESP-NOW, WiFi, CLI, MQTT, automation, and remote management features still available.
- Good for relay nodes and remote endpoints.

### 2) Hardware One (Standard Handheld)
- The intended full build: board + SSD1306 OLED + Seesaw gamepad + a selection of I2C sensors.
- Can be used from USB power or as a battery-powered handheld.
- Best fit when you want both the local OLED/gamepad UI and the web UI.

### 3) Sensor Appliance
- Build a dedicated single-purpose device around one or two sensors, such as thermal, GPS, RTC, ToF, or presence.
- Useful for fixed installs where you want one job done well without carrying the whole handheld stack.
- Can still expose data over web, CLI, automations, MQTT, and ESP-NOW.

### 4) Bonded Microcontrollers
- Control features unique to one device you flash while another device is flashed with other features - effectively removing the limit of software features that can be included due to iram constrictions
- A common example would be where one unit is the Display/Input Device and the other exposes hardware, sensors, or other features.
- The devices create an auth token during the bond sync / handshake process. This is used to execute commands with implicit trust between the devices to reduce the need to enter in username + password for every remote command.
- Command registries are shared between bonded peers, so when a command is queued for execution there is a check to see if the command trying to be executed is able to be found on the local command registry, or if its found on the bonded device's command registry. From there it will either execute the command locally, or reroute the command to the bonded device which will enqueue the command (so it is the same code path as a standard command), and then send the output back via ESP-NOW streaming.

## Supported Hardware

### Boards — pick one

Each device in your setup runs one board. Multiple boards can coexist on the same ESP-NOW mesh network simultaneously.

| Board | Camera | PDM Mic | Battery monitor | Notes |
| ----- | :----: | :-----: | :-------------: | ----- |
| Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Primary dev target |
| Adafruit QT PY ESP32-S3 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Stemma QT onboard |
| Adafruit Feather ESP32 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (GPIO35) | Good for battery builds |

### Peripherals — Stemma QT / I2C

These connect via Stemma QT (or standard I2C) and work the same on any supported board. Mix and match as needed.

## Build System

Hardware One uses **ESP-IDF** (not Arduino IDE). The quickest way to get going:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/CadenGithubB/HardwareOne.git
cd HardwareOne

# Build and flash (replace PORT with your device's serial port)
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

All user-configurable options (which sensors, which web modules, which network features) live in one file: `components/hardwareone/System_BuildConfig.h`. Flip the flags, rebuild, done.
