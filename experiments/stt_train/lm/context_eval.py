"""Does carrying LM context across phrases help? Consecutive-segment WER.

  context_eval.py --ckpt DIR --lm meeting.lm [--meetings 4] [--segments 150]

tune.py's sets are shuffled single utterances, so they cannot show what the
device does in continuous transcription: phrase N+1 follows phrase N. This
takes runs of consecutive AMI validation segments (one timeline per meeting,
all speakers, ordered by start time; SDM = one room mic, IHM = headsets) and
decodes each run in order four ways:
  base       every phrase starts at <s> and ends with </s> (the device today)
  open       starts at <s>, no </s> at the end
  ctx        starts from the previous phrase's DECODED last two words, </s>
  ctx-open   previous decoded words, no </s>
  oracle     previous REFERENCE words, no </s> (upper bound, not achievable)
Logits (float, CPU) are cached per checkpoint under work/lm/context/.
